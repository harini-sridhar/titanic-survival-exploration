# Project: Titanic Survival Exploration

In this project, decision functions are created that attempt to predict survival outcomes from the 1912 Titanic disaster based on each passenger's features, such as sex and age. A simple algorithm is used as a start and its complexity is increased until accurate predictions are made for at least 80% of the passengers in the provided data. 

## Software Requirements
This project uses the following software and Python libraries:

- [Python 3.6](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-368/)
- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)

## Starting the Project

This project contains three files:

- `titanic_survival_exploration.ipynb`: This is the main file.
- `titanic_data.csv`: The project dataset.
- `visuals.py`: This Python script provides supplementary visualizations for the project.
